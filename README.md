# Residential Energy Monitoring Dashboard (Power BI)


This Power BI dashboard was developed to track and analyze power consumption in a residential building at the appliance level (light bulbs). The visualization highlights daily, weekly, and monthly electricity usage patterns, enabling better understanding of consumption behavior and identification of high-use periods.

This Power BI dashboard was developed to track and analyze power consumption in a residential building at the appliance level (light bulbs). The visualization highlights daily, weekly, and monthly electricity usage patterns, enabling better understanding of consumption behavior and identification of high-use periods.

Key Features:

Real-time monitoring of electricity consumption by light bulbs.

Trend analysis of usage patterns across different time scales.

Interactive filters for exploring specific rooms or time intervals.

Clear visual indicators (KPIs, charts, and graphs) to support energy efficiency awareness.

This project demonstrates how data visualization can simplify energy monitoring in residential settings and support efforts to reduce unnecessary electricity consumption.
